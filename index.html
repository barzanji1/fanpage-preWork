            Sade's Bio February 2010: 
               Soldier of Love is released, 
            the sixth studio album the band 
            Sade have released during their 
            25 year career,
             and the first since Lovers Rock
              in 2000. For Sade herself, 
             as the lynchpin of the group’s 
             song writing effort, 
             it’s a simple matter of integrity
              and authenticity: 
             “I only make records when I feel 
             I have something to say.
              I’m not interested in releasing 
              music just for the sake of selling something.
               Sade is not a brand”.
